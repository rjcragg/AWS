Hello $(FullName),

The attached RDP files can be used to connect to your FME Virtual Machine.

Please wait 10 minutes after receiving this email before trying to connect the the virtual machine; they take approximately 10 minutes to boot.

Please try @Value(PublicIpAddress).rdp first. 
Double-click on @Value(PublicIpAddress).rdp to open it in Microsoft Remote Desktop.

The username is administrator
The password is FMElearnings#1

Some organizations block the port used by RDP; port 3389.

If @Value(PublicIpAddress).rdp does not work, please try the other two RDP files; @Value(PublicIpAddress)Port8080.rdp and @Value(PublicIpAddress)Port443.rdp.
These RDP files use different ports that might not be blocked.

If none of the RDP files will connect, then your Security Administrator is likely using a Web Security Gateway. 
This cannot be bypassed without contacting your IT Department. 
Please contact your IT Department, and tell them you need to use Remote Desktop to connect to @Value(PublicIpAddress) 

As a last-resort, you can try to use an HTML5 Remote Desktop Client.
Go to http://54.205.104.160/myrtille
Server: @Value(PublicIpAddress)
User: administrator
Password: FMElearnings#1
